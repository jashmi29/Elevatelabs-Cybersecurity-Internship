 Network Vulnerability Scanning, where basic network scanning was performed to identify open ports, services, and potential security risks on a target system.
The scanning was done using an online Nmap port scanning tool to understand how network vulnerabilities are detected and analyzed.

🔍 What was done
- Performed a network scan using an online Nmap tool
- Checked host reachability
- Scanned port 80 for open/closed status
- Identified the associated service
- Analyzed possible security risks
- Documented findings and mitigation steps

🛠 Tools Used
- Nmap Online Port Scanner – https://port.tools/nmap-online-port-scan/
- GeeksforGeeks – for understanding network scanning concepts
- ChatGPT – for guidance and explanation
- Web Browser – for research and scanning

📊 Key Findings
- Target system was reachable
- Port 80 was closed
- HTTP service was not accessible
- No immediate vulnerabilities were detected
- Risk level was Low

🎓 Purpose
- This task was performed as part of academic learning to understand network vulnerability scanning, how open ports and services can create security risks, and how regular scanning helps improve network security.
