Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Prioritization performed on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine using OpenVAS. The assessment focuses on identifying system vulnerabilities, analyzing them using CVE and CVSS scoring, and prioritizing risks based on severity and impact.

📄 Contents
- Vulnerability Assessment overview
- Installation and setup of OpenVAS
- Scan configuration and execution
- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) explanation
- CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) explanation
- Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Risk prioritization list
- Recommended remediation steps

🔍 Learning & Research Sources I referred to:
- OpenVAS official documentation
- GeeksforGeeks – for vulnerability assessment concepts
- Browser research for CVE & CVSS understanding

🧠 Tools Used
- OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager) – for scanning
- Oracle VM VirtualBox – for virtual lab setup
- Ubuntu – target operating system
- ChatGPT – for research assistance and content understanding

🎓 Purpose
- This work is part of my academic learning to understand how vulnerability assessments are performed in real-world environments and how risks are identified, classified, and prioritized for remediation.
