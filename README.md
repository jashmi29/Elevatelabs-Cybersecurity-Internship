Elevatelabs-Cybersecurity-Internship
- This repository contains my Cyber Security practical tasks, completed as part of my academic curriculum.
- The tasks focus on understanding core cybersecurity concepts, real-world attack techniques, and security testing practices, including log monitoring, phishing awareness, API security testing, and authorization validation using industry-standard tools.
- Each task combines theoretical understanding with practical implementation to analyze how modern systems are attacked and how they can be protected.
